NAME
    DB::CouchDB::Schema - A schema oriented CouchDB Module

CHANGES
    This is not longer much like DB::CouchDB::Schema by Jeremy Wall.
    It is just what I am using to access CouchDB.

NOTES ON TESTING AND USE
    To test against a live db, you need to set some environment variables.
    # environment vars used for testing CouchDB access
    # CDB_USER          username
    # CDB_PASS          your password
    # CDB_PORT          5984
    # CDB_HOST          localhost

    CDB_USER and CDB_PASS default to '', and if they are empty, the
    live db tests will be skipped.

    If you are running with a live db with a proper admin username and
    password and are seeing a lot of errors, then you probably have to
    fiddle a bit with your couchdb settings.  This module relies on an
    older way of triggering the login dialog.  I will fix it maybe
    eentually, but to get it to work now, just do this.  In your
    couchdb settings file, /etc/couchdb/local.ini, look for the
    following line:

    ; Uncomment next line to trigger basic-auth popup on unauthorized requests.
    ;WWW-Authenticate = Basic realm="administrator"

    Then uncomment the second line with the 'WWW-Authenticate' stuff.
    If you change the realm from administrator, then you'll have to
    tweak the source code here or set the realm option.
